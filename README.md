[1.5×2=3 points] ChatTPG is an AI-based company that lets customers get answers from an AI chatbot. It runs its service from a large data center containing many servers. To serve customers using its software, ChatTPG is considering two options:

Install the ChatTPG software on each of the servers. Customers will log into the servers directly and interact with the chatbot.

Run hypervisors on the servers, with multiple virtual machines running on each hypervisor. The virtual machines will be equipped with the ChatTPG software. Customers will log into the virtual machines and interact with the chatbot there.

Which option would be better? Why? Please explain your choice with detailed justifications.
